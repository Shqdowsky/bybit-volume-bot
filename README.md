# bybit-volume-bot
How it works: First, the bot buys a token for 50% of the amount you have on the spot, and then sets a limit for sale at a price 0.01% lower than the purchase price and continues to trade at this price. There are also cases of redemption of your limits, in which case the bot will again buy the token on the market, and drawdowns and price increases are also provided for, if this happens, then a limit will be set at a new price, and in some cases, when the bot will buy a token at a higher price amount. If the amount exceeds 50%, he sells the excess tokens on the market.
